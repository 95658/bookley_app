Pace"],"publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","publishedDate":"2012-09-13","description":"Mathematics plays a key role in computer science, some researchers would consider computers as nothing but the physical embodiment of mathematical systems. And whether you are designing a digital circuit, a computer program or a new programming language, you need mathematics to be able to reason about the design -- its correctness, robustness and dependability. This book covers the foundational mathematics necessary for courses in computer science. The common approach to presenting mathematical concepts and operators is to define them in terms of properties they satisfy, and then based on these definitions develop ways of computing the result of applying the operators and prove them correct. This book is mainly written for computer science students, so here the author takes a different approach: he starts by defining ways of calculating the results of applying the operators and then proves that they satisfy various properties. After justifying his underlying approach the author offers detailed chapters covering propositional logic, predicate calculus, sets, relations, discrete structures, structured types, numbers, and reasoning about programs. The book contains chapter and section summaries, detailed proofs and many end-of-section exercises -- key to the learning process. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, and although the treatment focuses on areas with frequent applications in computer science, the book is also suitable for students of mathematics and engineering.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783642298400"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3642298400"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":296,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.7.9.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=computer+science&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kYYJLhL2arwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":1930.95,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amount":1930.95,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&rdid=book-kYYJLhL2arwC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":1930950000,"currencyCode":"EGP"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":1930950000,"currencyCode":"EGP"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/Mathematics_of_Discrete_Structures_for_C-sample-epub.acsm?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/Mathematics_of_Discrete_Structures_for_C-sample-pdf.acsm?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=kYYJLhL2arwC&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book covers the foundational mathematics necessary for courses in computer science."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"d8AaeYeLVK8C","etag":"JMr4jW1sBlk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/d8AaeYeLVK8C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology","subtitle":"First International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology, CCSIT 2011, Bangalore, India, January 2-4, 2011.

Taking an active learning approach, the text encourages students to explore computing ideas by running programs and testing them on different inputs. It also features illustrations by Phil Foglio, winner of the 2009 and 2010 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Novel. Classroom-Tested Material The first four chapters introduce key concepts, such as algorithms and scalability, and hone practical lab skills for creating and using objects. In the remaining chapters, the author covers \"divide and conquer\" as a problem solving strategy, the role of data structures, issues related to encoding data, computer architecture, random numbers, challenges for natural language processing, computer simulation, and genetic algorithms. Through a series of interactive projects in each chapter, students can experiment with one or more algorithms that illustrate the main topic. Requiring no prior experience with programming, these projects show students how algorithms provide computational solutions to real-world problems. Web Resource The book’s website at www.cs.uoregon.edu/eic presents numerous ancillaries. The lab manual offers step-by-step instructions for installing Ruby and the RubyLabs gem with Windows XP, Mac OS X, and Linux. The manual includes tips for editing programs and running commands in a terminal emulator. The site also provides online documentation of all the modules in the RubyLabs gem.
